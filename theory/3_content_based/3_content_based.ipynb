    "[Jester](http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/about.html) is a joke recommender system developed at UC Berkeley to study social information filtering. Their [dataset](http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/) contains over 5 million anonymous joke ratings from 150k users. In this case, we will use the **Dataset 1** which contains over 4.1 million \n",
